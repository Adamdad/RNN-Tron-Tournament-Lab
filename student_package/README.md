# RNN Tron Challenge - Student Package

Welcome to the RNN Tron Challenge! In this assignment, you'll train an RNN Agent to compete in the Tron game.

## What's Included

```

├── README.md              # This file
├── student_template.py    # Your starting template - MODIFY THIS!
├── tron_env.py           # Game environment (for local testing)
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── packages.txt          # System dependencies (for pygame)

├── train_Y.npy          # Training labels (provided by instructor)
└── submissions/          # Where to save your trained model
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Linux, you may also need system dependencies for pygame:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

### 2. Modify the Template

Open `student_template.py` and:

1. **Fill in your information** (lines 10-15):
```python
STUDENT_INFO = {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "student_id": "Your Student ID",
    "team_name": "Your Team Name",
    "description": "Brief description of your approach"
}
```

2. **Design your model** (lines 19-28):
```python
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # TODO: Define your network architecture
        # Default is a simple LSTM, but you can modify it!
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(10, 64, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64, 4)
```

### 3. Train Your Model

```bash
python student_template.py --train --epochs 20
```

This will save your trained model to `submissions/your_name_agent.pth`

### 4. Test Your Agent Locally

You can test your agent visually:

```python
from student_template import StudentAgent
from tron_env import BlindTronEnv
import random

agent = StudentAgent()
env = BlindTronEnv(render_mode=True)

# Run a test game
obs1, obs2 = env.reset()
agent.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action = agent.get_action(obs1)
    # Random action for opponent
    opponent_action = random.randint(0, 3)
    obs1, obs2, done, winner = env.step(action, opponent_action)

print(f"Game over! Winner: {winner}")
```

Save this as `test_agent.py` and run it to see your agent in action!

### 5. Submit Your Solution

Submit two files:
1. `student_template.py` (or your renamed version like `alice_agent.py`)
2. `submissions/your_name_agent.pth` (your trained weights)

## Tips for Success

1. **Understand the observation**: The input is a 10-dimensional vector:
   - 8 direction distances (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) - normalized 0-1
   - 2 normalized coordinates (x, y)

2. **Action space**: 4 actions
   - 0 = UP
   - 1 = DOWN
   - 2 = LEFT
   - 3 = RIGHT

3. **Model constraints**:
   - Maximum 100,000 parameters
   - Must implement `StudentAgent` class
   - Must have `get_action()` and `reset()` methods

4. **Try different architectures**:
   - LSTM/GRU with different hidden sizes
   - Multiple LSTM layers
   - Add dropout for regularization
   - Try attention mechanisms
   - Experiment with different sequence lengths

5. **Training tips**:
   - Start with default settings, then experiment
   - Monitor accuracy on training data
   - Try different learning rates
   - Increase epochs if needed (but watch for overfitting)

## File Descriptions

### student_template.py
Your main file to modify. Contains:
- `STUDENT_INFO`: Your team information
- `MyModel`: Your neural network architecture
- `StudentAgent`: The agent class (do NOT rename this class!)
- `train()`: Training function

### tron_env.py
The Tron game environment. Key features:
- 20x20 grid
- Two players (you vs opponent)
- Ray-casting observations (8 directions)
- Collision detection

### train_X.npy & train_Y.npy
Training data generated by the instructor. Contains expert demonstrations for imitation learning.

## Rules & Constraints

1. You can only modify `student_template.py` (or create a copy with your name)
2. Class name must remain `StudentAgent`
3. Model must have fewer than 100,000 parameters
4. Training must use the provided dataset
5. No hard-coding of specific game strategies

## Evaluation

Your agent will compete against other students in a round-robin tournament:
- Win: 3 points
- Draw: 1 point
- Loss: 0 points

The final ranking is based on total points and number of wins.

## Getting Help

1. Check the comments in the template files
2. Ask questions during office hours
3. Discuss strategies with classmates (but don't share code!)

Good luck and have fun!
